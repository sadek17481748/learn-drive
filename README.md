# Deployment

## Local Development Environment


## Version Control Using Git

Version control was managed using **Git**. This allowed me to track changes to the project over time, revert to previous versions if needed, and maintain a clear history of development progress. The workflow included:

1. **Initialising Git**: The local project folder was initialised as a Git repository using `git init`.  
2. **Staging Changes**: After making changes to files, I staged them using:
 *git add .*
This added all new or modified files to the staging area in preparation for committing.  
3. **Committing Changes**: Commits were made regularly with descriptive messages summarising the changes:  
git commit -m "Add homepage layout and carousel functionality"
4. **Pushing to Remote Repository**: Changes were then pushed to the remote repository on GitHub to keep the online version up-to-date:
This process was repeated continuously during development to ensure that every key change was backed up and versioned.
git push
## Creating the GitHub Repository

A **GitHub account** was created to host the project remotely. The repository was created with the following steps:


## Deployment Using GitHub Pages

The website was deployed online using **GitHub Pages**, which allows static websites to be hosted directly from a GitHub repository. The deployment process involved:

1. Opening the repository settings and navigating to the **Pages** section.  
2. Selecting the **main branch** as the source branch and the **root folder** as the deployment folder.  
3. GitHub Pages then generated a live URL for the website: 
https://sadek17481748.github.io/worldofhistory/



## Updating the Live Website

Once deployed, any updates to the website are automatically reflected on the live site whenever new commits are pushed to the **main branch** of the GitHub repository. This allows the live website to stay up-to-date with the latest development changes without manual redeployment.

## Live Website

The website is live and accessible via GitHub Pages at:
